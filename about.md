Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Jeroen Reijn. I'm a seasoned software engineer, (Cloud) architect, and tech lead. I specialize in Java, AWS, cloud-native development, and open-source technologies.

Born and raised in Amsterdam, The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± I always had a passion for computers and technology. In 2003 I started my professional career as a Java software engineer at Hippo Webworks, which later became Hippo (CMS). Over the years I performed several roles at Hippo. I've acted as a consultant, trainer, software engineer and solution architect. During the last couple of years I worked as the Lead Architect within Hippo's international Professional Services department. Six months after I left Hippo, it got acquired by Bloomreach.

In 2016 I joined Luminis as a consultant and over the last 5 years I've been focussing on AWS. In 2022 I got accepted into the [AWS Community Builders program](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) in the category Serverless.

I occasionally publish technical articles, appear in podcasts and recordings, and speak at conferences and meetups. For a full overview see, see [presentations](/presentations.md).
