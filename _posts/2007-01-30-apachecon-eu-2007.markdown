Well it seems <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2007/EU/html/sessions.html/e=MjAwNy9FVQ" target="_blank">the word is out</a> and our <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/" target="_blank">ApacheCon</a> talk has been accepted! We were waiting for a confirmation before spreading the word, but the schedule seems to be final now.

<img src="http://www.apache.org/ads/ApacheCon/2007-europe-234x60.png" align="right" style="padding-right:5px;padding-bottom:2px;"/> Jasha and I were pretty amazed to hear that our proposal was selected out of all the submissions. Looking at the speakers list it's amazing to see us between all those well known Apache member and committer names. The fun part is though that if you look at the list, it seems that we're almost the only two speakers who are not in some sort affiliated with the Apache Foundation other then using one of it's great products: <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Cocoon</a>.

It seems that us rookies will have to compete with two big shots for audience. It's too bad that <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2007/EU/html/speakers.html/e=MjAwNy9FVQ#U5572" target="_blank">Ate Douma</a> is speaking at the same time, since I was curious about his talk on <em>"JSR-286: Portlet Specification 2.0 for Portal and Portlet Developers"</em>. I've been working closely with Ate lately on a new and exciting Hippo <a href="http://www.hippoportal.org/display/PORTAL/Home" target="_blank">project</a>, so the portal subject really interests me.

It seems Apache Cocoon is closing the ApacheCon Friday with <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/" target="_blank">Andrew</a> coming right after us with "<em>Web 2.0 with Cocoon 2.2</em>". I think the order is great, because you can go from a novice to an experienced session. We hope to get your Cocoon knowledge up to date for Andrews session later that day.

If you're interested in what Apache Cocoon is all about, be sure to come and visit our session! Remember: "<em>Basic web application development with Apache Cocoon</em>" is where you have to be! ;-) We're more then willing to answer all your questions and hope you will enjoy our talk.

See you on the 4th of May!
