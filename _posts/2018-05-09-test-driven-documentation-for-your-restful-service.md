Three weeks ago I presented at [Luminis Devcon 2018](https://devcon.luminis.eu) about the challenges of designing and documenting REST APIs. The reason I gave this presentation was that about 8 months ago I started on a new project for which my team had to develop a public facing REST API. Having a good documentation for such an API is very important, since users will read the docs and have an opinion about the usage and correctness of such an API. 
During my presentation I went into the lifecycle of an API and how to maintain the documentation in such a way that it's always in sync with the actual API, since these can easily drift apart.

The presentation was recorded and is now available on Youtube.

I've also published the slides, this time in correct order, so you can read through them if you don't want to watch the entire video. During my presentation some slides were in the incorrect order, because just before the presentation my Apple Magic Mouse was turned on in my bag and had somehow resuffle some of my slides. Yeah, I know, lucky me :-/.

In case you're wondering about the IntelliJ Live Templates I created for this demo, I just created a [public gist](https://gist.github.com/jreijn/7dabed8076a6cab39efa05a51bee826d) for them.
