<div class='post'>
Blogging has not been one of my priorities these past couple of months as you might have noticed. I've been so busy at the <a href="http://www.onehippo.com">Hippo</a> office and at customers, that I was unable to find some decent time to start a new blog post.<br/><br/>I realize I should have written this post 6 months ago, since the project I'm going to write about has been around even longer than that, but as far as I can remember, nobody has ever written a post about it. I think that's a shame and you guys should be made aware of this piece of software.<br/><br/>A new set of development component were created to develop web application with JSP or JSF in combination with Hippo CMS. We called it the <a href="http://hst.hippocms.org/index.html" title="Hippo Site Toolkit">Hippo Site Toolkit</a> and it has been available for quite some time.<br/><br/>The HST will allow us to provide default component that aid developers in their work  while building web applications with JSP or for instance <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org">Apache MyFaces</a>.<br/><br/>There are some example projects available from the Hippo SVN, so be sure to check it out if you're thinking about using JSP or JSF.<br/><br/></div>
