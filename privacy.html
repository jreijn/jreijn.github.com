  <h1>Privacy</h1>
  <p>This website collects anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of the pages you viewed.
Some 3rd parties like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services. I can’t control them but I don’t believe this knowledge poses any threat to you.</p>

  <h2>Measuring visitors</h2>

  <p>Visitors on this website are measured using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.</p>

  <p>The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.</p>

  <p>You can learn more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.</p>

  <h2>Facebook, Twitter and other social networks</h2>

  <p>These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” and “Tweet” buttons.</p>

  <p>To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.</p>

  <p>Social networks therefore could know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users.</p>

  <h2>Discussion comments</h2>

  <p>To allow visitors to discuss our blog articles and some web pages we use a discussion system called Disqus.</p>

  <p>To do so we embed code that Disqus provide and we do not control ourselves. Disqus anonymously tracks visitors to pages like we do. They also remember who you are if you login to any Disqus service, so you can comment on any website using their tool.</p>

  <p>Logging in to Disqus can be done in many ways, including via Facebook. If you login via social network, Disqus will be able to link your activity to that network. In this way, your Disqus activity may be personally identifiable.</p>

  <p>Disqus will know what pages you viewed in our site and what you wrote on those comments. Of course all comments you leave are also publicly visible on the Internet alongside your name, so we do not imagine this is a concern for many people.</p>
