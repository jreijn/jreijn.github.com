Hello üëã!

My name is Jeroen Reijn and this is my personal website. I'm an experienced Solutions Architect, specializing in AWS, Java, and cloud-native development. With a career spanning over two decades working on resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, I've worn many hats, including software engineer, consultant, trainer and software architect.

I work at [Luminis](https://www.luminis.eu) as a Cloud Solutions Architect, where I help customers benefit from Public Cloud Computing. I focus on AWS and due to sharing my experience on my blog, at meetups, and at conferences, I have been accepted into the [AWS Community Builder program](https://builder.aws.com/connect/community/community-builders) since August of 2022.

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or sharing my expertise, you‚Äôll find me experimenting with emerging technologies and contributing to open source.
