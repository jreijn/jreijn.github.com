title: Hippo in the US of A

I could not have been more lucky. During the <a href="http://www.cocoongt.org" target="_blank">Cocoon GT</a> I found out I had to take another business trip to New York a couple of days later. It was going to be my first visit to the US and I was really looking forward to it.

Taking a cab from the airport to downtown Manhattan gives you an amazing view of the New York skyline. After arriving at the clients office, we had two days filled with meetings. The talks I had were very interesting and I've met some great and very high skilled people.
The three days went by very quickly.Luckily on Friday I had a couple hours off to walk around town. I must say it's really an amazing city that never sleeps. I'm thinking of taking a vacation to see more of what New York has to offer. I still need to see so many things. A small <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reijnj/sets/72157602436898640/" target="_blank">impression</a> of my walk can be found on <a href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.

I really hope to visit NY again in the near future.
