title: Hippo CMS in Italian
---

The great thing of having an Open Source CMS is getting feedback and contributions from the community. Last night I had such a moment when Marco Casavecchia Morganti send me an email that he had translated <a href="http://www.hippocms.org" target="_blank">Hippo CMS</a> entirely to Italian. He wondered if we were interested in the Italian translations? Sure we are! As a matter of fact I committed the translations today into the trunk and 6.05 branch of the CMS. So the 6.05.01 release will also have an Italian translation pack.

Thanks again Marco for you contribution!
