title: 'This week: ApacheCon Europe 2009'
---

This week is <a href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com/c/aceu2009/">ApacheCon Europe</a> week. I'm afraid I won't be able to attend any sessions during the actual conference, but I am going to attend some of the meetup sessions on Monday and Tuesday evening.<br />For those of you that are attending the conference, I can say that the program looks really promising and has a lot to offer.<br /><br />If you're attending the ApacheCon on Thursday, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com/c/aceu2009/sessions/162">Niels's talk on "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Documentation: get it right!</span>"</a>
