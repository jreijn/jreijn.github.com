title: Attending ApacheCon Europe 2006
---

It looks like some fellow [Hippo](http://www.hippo.nl/en/index.html) developers and myself will be attending the ApacheCon Europe 2006 in Dublin next month.
This will be my first big Apache Conference with developers from different projects within the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).
I'm really exited about it and while looking at the sessions, my interest is going out to the Ajax and Apache MyFaces sessions (next to the Cocoon sessions of course).

I noticed more Cocooners are joining me in Dublin and it looks like Cocoon is well represented at the ApacheCon with people like [Gianugo Rabellino](http://www.rabellino.it/blog/) (SourceSense), [Bertrand Delacr√©taz](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/) (Codeconsult) , [Carsten Ziegeler](http://www.osoco.org/weblogs/rael/) (S&N) and [Doug Tidwell](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/speakers/dtidwell/) (IBM) doing session about Cocoon.

I also see that there are some sessions on other CMS's. Maybe it's an idea to do a session on <a href="http://www.hippocms.org/" target="_blank">Hippo CMS</a> next year? Sounds like a great idea to me! ;-)
