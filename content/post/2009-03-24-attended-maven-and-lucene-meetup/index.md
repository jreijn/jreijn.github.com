title: Attended the Maven and Lucene Meetup
---

Since I'm not able to attend the actual <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/">ApacheCon</a> conference days I decided to join some of the pre-conference  meetups.

On monday evening I joined <a href="http://blog.jasha.eu/">Jasha</a> and some other fellow Hippos to the Maven meetup, were I was hoping to hear some new and interesting stuff. Maven has been one of my default development tools for over more then 3 years.This was the first time I actually met other users and developers from the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> community. I think there were around 40 people at the meetup and some interesting topics came along.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jroller.com/carlossg/">Carlos Sanchez</a>  talked about the effort they're putting in the "<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/iam/" class="externalLink">Eclipse IAM</a>" project over at the Eclipse foundation. I just recently started using the m2eclipse plugin in my <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>, which seems to suite my needs, but the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/iam/" class="externalLink">Eclipse IAM</a> plugin looked really interesting. Towards the end of the Maven meetup Jasha and I left for a chat with <a href="http://reflectingonthevicissitudes.wordpress.com/">Grzegorz Kossakowski</a>. It was good seeing you again Grzegorz!<br /><br />Tuesday evening was an evening packed with interesting meetups, but unfortunately they were all at the same time. In the end I went to the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> Meetup, where I stayed until 21.30. It was good to see so many people (60+) at the meetup and after an introduction round it was nice to found out that other open source content management vendors were also present at the meetup.<br /><br />I was especially interested in the talks about <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>. Most of the attendees were Solr users as far as I could see. After some presentations the attendees started asking questions and talking about the number of documents in their Lucene/Solr indexes and I was a bit blown away by the amount of documents some of them had in their lucene index. It ranged from 300.000 to tens of millions, which is really a lot. For me, from a content management perspective, I really wondered what kind of content it was and I would love to see that amount of content in our CMS.<br /><br />Well that was my ApacheCon for this year. I'm curious too see where the ApacheCon Europe will be held next year. Hope to see you all next year...
