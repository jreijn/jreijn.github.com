title: Hippo CMS on Ohloh.net
---

<a href="http://www.hippocms.org" target="_blank">Hippo CMS</a> is getting a lot of attention in the Netherlands and around Europe these days, but of course our goal is to make it a world-wide well known product. The only way to achieve that is by promoting it a bit more then letting the product promote itself.

Recently I came across <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/" target="_blank">Ohloh</a>. Ohloh is a source directory that helps you find the software product you need. With some help of tags, stacks and the Ohloh community you can find some great pieces of software.

To help developers find Hippo CMS, it has recently been added as a <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/5378" target="_blank">project</a> to Ohloh.

Even though Ohloh is still under development it's fun to see what the Ohloh team does with your source code. It can give you a good view on how active the committers of a project really are, how many committers are involved in a software product and there is so much more interesting information that Ohloh retrieves from your source code repository. I was actually surprised by the source code statistics which stated that the amount of Javascript/Flowscript used in the CMS was about 65% and only 6% Java code has been written until now. Since the CMS is based on Apache Cocoon there is a lot more Java involved, but that's inserted with some help of Maven.</p>
<p>Ohloh is still updating, but I've just also added <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/5412" target="_blank">Hippo Portal</a> and <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6413" target="_blank">Hippo Repository</a>.
