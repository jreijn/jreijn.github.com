title: ApacheCon Europe 2007 proposal
---

The <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/" target="_blank">ApacheCon EU 2007</a> is coming up and the deadline for proposals ended last night. I've seen <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/archives/001245.html" target="_blank">several</a> ApacheCon <a href="http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000750.html" target="_blank">proposals</a> come by over the past weeks and was thinking together was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jashaj/269498036/" target="_blank">Jasha</a> that we had to do something ourselves this year.
We've both worked on a lot of projects build with Apache Cocoon for a couple of years now and know most of the pains when starting with Cocoon, so we decided to submit a proposal ourselves: "Basic web application development with Apache Cocoon".

If the proposal gets approved the session will be very low level. As less code as possible, but more of an explanation about what can be done with Cocoon, how Cocoon handles itself in the web 2.0 hype these days and why Cocoon could be useful for you.
Cocoon can do so much more then most people think. You can create really powerful applications, high performance websites and multi-publishing platforms.

We'll just see what happens next!
