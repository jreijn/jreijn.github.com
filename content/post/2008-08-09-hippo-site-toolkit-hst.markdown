title: The Hippo Site Toolkit (HST)
---

Blogging has not been one of my priorities these past couple of months as you might have noticed. I've been so busy at the <a href="http://www.onehippo.com">Hippo</a> office and at customers, that I was unable to find some decent time to start a new blog post.

I realize I should have written this post 6 months ago, since the project I'm going to write about has been around even longer than that, but as far as I can remember, nobody has ever written a post about it. I think that's a shame and you guys should be made aware of this piece of software.

A new set of development component were created to develop web application with JSP or JSF in combination with Hippo CMS. We called it the <a href="http://hst.hippocms.org/index.html" title="Hippo Site Toolkit">Hippo Site Toolkit</a> and it has been available for quite some time.

The HST will allow us to provide default component that aid developers in their work  while building web applications with JSP or for instance <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org">Apache MyFaces</a>.

There are some example projects available from the Hippo SVN, so be sure to check it out if you're thinking about using JSP or JSF.
