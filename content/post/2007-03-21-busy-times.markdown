The past couple of weeks have been crazy. I've been all over the place and today I can finally find some time to start with our ApacheCon presentation.
Last week I've been visiting some Hippo <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/" target="_blank">friends</a> in the UK.
I always love to visit London, because it's such a great place. Especially the soho district, where their office is located, is full of these small foodshops and restaurants.
It's really nice and I should really take some vacation and go there for a couple of days and see all the nice things around town.

On monday I had some spare time in the evening to go for beers and dinner with <a title="Andrews weblog" target="_blank" href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/">Andrew</a> and <a title="Jeremys weblog" target="_blank" href="http://blog.fiveone.org/">Jeremy</a>.
Great to see you guys again! We talked about the upcoming <a title="ApacheCon" target="_blank" href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com">ApacheCon</a> in Amsterdam and we're all a bit concerned about the fast upcoming deadline for our presentations, which ends March 23th.
That's more then a month in advance! Jasha and I will really have to put some more effort in it to reach that deadline. I also noticed that the Early Bird registration ends this Friday, so you better make sure you have registered, because it saves you quite some money!

More good news on the Apache front: Andews vote was a <a href="http://marc.info/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=117344957209893&w=2" target="_blank">success</a> and the result was: 22 positive votes. I hope that in a couple of days all the paperwork is done and I can be proud to say that I'm part of the Apache family :-)
