title: Cocoon GT edition 5 is coming up
---

Year in year out people travel around the world to spread the word about this great product called <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Cocoon</a>. From ApacheCon's to OSCON's you will find people doing talks about Cocoon. The best place for talking about Cocoon is the annual <a href="http://www.cocoongt.org" target="_blank">Cocoon GetTogether</a> where people from around the world meet and share knowledge about Cocoon.

This october will be edition number five of the Cocoon GetTogether and it will be held in Amsterdam, just like last year. The only difference with last year will be, that all events will take place at one location: <a href="http://www.felixmeritis.nl/" target="_blank">The Felix Meritis</a>.
Last years hackathon was succesfull, so this year there will be two days of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackathon</a> again. The third day will be the conference day, where there will be a lot of people talking about new features, Cocoon's roadmap, existing projects and so on.

This years GT will be held from 2-4 October. Currently the counter is at 40 people from 7 different countries and it's still a month to go! It looks like this will be another succesfull year for the CocoonGT.

I will be there. Will you?
