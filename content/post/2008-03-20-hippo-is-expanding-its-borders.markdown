title: Hippo is expanding its borders
---

Some of you might have seen <a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/news,2008/03/bluesunrise.html">the news</a> out there on the web, but for those that did not, Hippo has expanded it's borders to the US! Last week it all became final and <a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/home">Hippo</a> bought <a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/about_us/bluesunrise">BlueSunrise</a>.

Hippo and BlueSunrise have known each other for a while now, because both companies are very active inside the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>. The <a href="http://portals.apache.org/">Apache Portals project</a> is one specific project that both have been working on over the past couple of years.<br/><br/>I think this expansion was to be expected, since we had an ongoing demand from clients outside Europe and mainly in the US. To be able to give sufficient support to these clients it's best to have a Hippo location in the same country.<br/><br/>It's great to see a company grow like this. I've been working at Hippo since early 2003 and I can remember sitting with 6 of my colleagues at the Hippo office in a building somewhere in the north of Amsterdam.Now ... 5 years later, we have about 45 people working at Hippo and multiple locations around the world.<br/><br/>I'm excited to see what will be next...<br/><br/></div>
