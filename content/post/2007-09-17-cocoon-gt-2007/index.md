title: Cocoon GT 2007
---

Well the <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Cocoon</a> GetTogether 2007 is coming up. It's only a bit more then two weeks from now. Have you <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cocoongt.org/Registration.html" alt="Register">registered</a>? I know I just did! Be sure to register on time, because the space is limited. I think Rome will be a great place for a GT. I've never been to Rome myself, so I think it's going to be a great experience and I'm definitely going to bring my camera.

I can't wait to meet up with all my fellow Cocooners, have some laughs, drink some beers, eat some great food and see what's hot in the world of Cocoon. For the hackathon there are some plans to do some Cocoon 2.2 integration with <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/" alt="Apache Wicket" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a>. I've noticed there are a lot of people spending time on Wicket, so it's a framework to take into account.

Of course there will be a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hippo.nl">Hippo</a> team present. You can probably spot us by the blue t-shirt with the big red Hippo's on the back. Have you used the <a href="http://www.hippocms.org" target="_blank">CMS</a> before or you're perhaps thinking about it, just walk bye and come and have a chat!

See you in Rome!
