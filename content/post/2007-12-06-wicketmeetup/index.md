title: WicketMeetup
---

Last Friday I had the pleasure to visit one of the first big <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a> meetups in the Netherlands. At the Felix Meritus, the same place as where the Cocoon GT 2006 took place, I was able to listen to a couple of the brightest Apache Wicket minds.

Looking at the amount of people that came to the NL Wicket meetup it reflects the activity of the Wicket Community. Even though the meetup was arranged on a very short notice, about 94 people attended. That's a great number if you ask me. I guess most of them were dutch, but also a couple of developers from outside of the Netherlands attended the meetup.<br/><br/>For an impression of the event you can take a look <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=wicketmeetup&m=tags" target="_blank">here</a> .
