title: Internet Explorer on Ubuntu
---

<div class='post'>
The other day I discovered <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/index-en.html" target="_blank">IEs 4 Linux - Internet Explorers for Linux</a>. This great tool gives me another reason to start developing my web applications in my Ubuntu development environment. IEs 4 Linux gives you the full power of IE 5.0-6.0 inside linux in combination with <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>. The installation was very easy. No clicks needed. No boring setup processes. No Wine complications. Just one easy script and you'll get three IE versions. What else could you wish for right?<br/><br/>After having used FireFox, Thunderbird and Eclipse for many years, I can not see why I would not be able to do my daily work in a linux environment these days. Now I just need to convince my boss ;-)<br/><br/></div>
