title: A pleasant surprise
---

Coming back from a vacation always means you'll have to catch up on all your e-mail. Thank god for spam-filters, otherwise I would have gone nuts on all the e-mails. While reading up on my mail, I was pleasantly surprised by <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=117308286100001&r=1&w=2" target="_blank">this</a> e-mail on the <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org" target="_blank">Cocoon</a> developers list. <strong>Thanks <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/" target="_blank">Andrew</a>!</strong> I was totally not expecting this and even <a href="http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/" target="_blank">Arjé</a> was astonished how speechless I was about it for the rest of the day.

Last year I worked closely with Andrew on several large Cocoon projects. Now that I'm thinking about it I've already been using Apache Cocoon for almost 4 years now and still enjoy working with it every day. Time flies I must say.

I'm also very happy to see that <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=117312368700003&r=1&w=2" target="_blank">Felix</a> is getting the same trust from the Cocoon community as I'm getting. I know Felix through Cocoon and <a href="http://www.hippocms.org" target="_blank">Hippo CMS</a> and we met last year for a couple of minutes in one of the restaurants at the Cocoon GT. Felix has been putting a lot of effort into Cocoon 2.2 lately, so I think he really deserves it! Keep up the good work Felix!
